# node-ytdlp
Just another GUI impl for yt-dlp. Currently only tested on Windows 10 and will probably break on Linux/macOS. 
Meant to run on local network only, the main idea was to let mobile devices leverage a yt-dlp install running on a PC/server.

## Running

### NOTE: yt-dlp must already be installed and in your $PATH for this to work.

1. Clone repo or download zip
2. Extract if necessary
3. cd to extracted/cloned $directory
4. `npm i && npm run dev`
5. App now live on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
