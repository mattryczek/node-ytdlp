# node-ytdlp
Just another GUI impl for yt-dlp. Currently only tested on Windows 10 and will probably break on Linux/macOS. 
Meant to run on local network only, the main idea was to let mobile devices leverage a yt-dlp install running on a PC/server.

## Running

1. Clone repo or download zip
2. Extra if necessary
3. cd to $directory
4. `npm i && npm run dev`
5. App now live on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
